    <center>Instagram is a free photo and video sharing app available on iPhone and Android. <br>
    People can upload photos or videos to our service and share them with their followers or with a select group <br>
     of friends. They can also view, comment <br>
     and like posts shared by their friends on Instagram.

     The name Instagram is a portmanteau of “instant camera” and “telegram.” Systrom wanted the name to be easy <br>
     to pronounce, <br>
     spell and follow the “right here, right now” concept.
